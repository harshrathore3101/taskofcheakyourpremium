            As such, the recent rumor about Google’s plan for the Pixel Buds’
            second generation — expected next fall — might seem surprising, but
            it’s really not. If Google wants to play with Apple and the other
            big boys in hardware, it must cement its place in the headphone
            lexicon.

            That’s doubly true since the company followed Apple in cutting the
            headphone jack from its Pixel 2 phone; otherwise Google is
            essentially throwing millions out the window.

            early stumbles. Here are five things Google has to do to make the
            Pixel Buds 2 not suck.

            This is an obvious one given the competition, though also a somewhat
            awkward assertion given this writer’s history in calling out true
            wireless earbuds’ troubled past (and present, really). That said,
            new technology advancements such as improved Near Field Magnetic
            Induction (which connects earbuds through your skull) — as well as
            coming advancements Bluetooth — have made it easier than ever to go
            wire-free.

            Further, the fact that Google put all its battery tech, hardware,
            and controls inside the big black buds themselves — instead of in
            the cable like so many other wireless earbuds — means Google
            obviously wanted to make its first headphones totally wireless, but
            was unable (or unwilling) to trust its skills at cutting the final
            connection.

            Battery life is one of the biggest issues with true wireless
            earbuds. Most first-gen true wireless earbuds barely cracked the
            three-hour barrier per charge (if that), while the AirPods helped
            push the baseline to a still-mediocre five hours. It’s not easy to
            cram a long-lasting battery into a small pair of earbuds which
            require a constant electronic connection to your smartphone.

            Google’s original Pixel Buds battery just matched the AirPods — even
            though the PBs weren’t fully wireless — and that’s just not good
            enough. You can bet Apple’s AirPods 2 will offer at least a modest
            boost in battery life, and if Google wants to make any waves, the
            Pixel Buds 2 need to go even further.
